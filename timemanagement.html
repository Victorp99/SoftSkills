        <p>Employers in every industry are looking for staff who can make optimal use of the time available to them on the job. Workers who have the ability to time manage will save time for the company and saving time saves money and increases revenue.</p>
        <p>There are going to be times when you have a lot of tasks that are due at the same time. This can get overwhelming if you don’t take action and try to manage your time. If you are able to manage your time, you will be able to get all your goals done within the time they are due.</p>

          <p>Individuals who have good time management are able to manage their time in order to be more productive, efficient, and meet timelines they have. Effective time management requires that the individual analyzes their workload, assign priorities and maintain focus on productive activities. People with good time management also tend to eliminate distractions and get help from their co-workers to help them accomplish their goals.</p>
<h2>Dependable</h2>
<p>Having good time management skills makes you a more dependable worker which is another characteristic employers are looking for. If you are on top of your tasks and get them all done efficiently due to effective planning, your employer will trust you with more important tasks and this will increase your value.</p>
<h2>Flexible</h2>
<p>Getting tasks finished early due to good time planning, can also allow you to become more flexible in your workplace. Being flexible is another characteristic that employers find important. Deadlines and projects can change at any moment and you as the worker need to be able to adapt quickly in order to still meet deadlines. Prioritization is key to being flexible when a requirement changes in the product. When you are flexible, to the employer, it entails that you are willing and able to respond to changing circumstances and expectations.</p>

            <p>There are many ways to improve upon your time management skills. One of the most important ideas to keep in mind when you are managing your time is to complete the most important tasks first. Once you are done with those tasks, you may move on to others.</p>
<p>Another idea to keep in mind is to be able to say no. Having a lot of time commitments can teach us how to handle our time, but there can be a point where you can take on too much. You don’t want to overwhelm yourself so saying no can save you. By saying no to events such as social gatherings or other small work tasks, you are learnign to prioritize and manage time efficiently.</p>
<p>To stay on top of your game, you also have to be well rested. Get at least 7 to 8 hours of sleep. You need sleep so that your mind works optimally. The difference is whether you get a lot of lower quality hours of work, or fewer higher quality hours of work. You end up accomplishing a lot more when you work optimally for less hours than you do when you work at a lower level for many hours.</p>
<p>Another good practice is to create an organizing system. Being organized helps you save a lot of time. You don’t need to be super organized, but being slightly organized helps save more time than having everything in chaos. A filing system for documents can help you know where everything is and be able to access information quicker.</p>
