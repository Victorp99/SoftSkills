        <p>People skills cover a large variety of skills that an employer would want an employee to have. Overall, people skills deal with how you work and interact with other people. This may be in a working setting or in a social setting. People skills are important to the employer because you are going to be constantly working with people.</p>
        <p>You will need to be able to work and understand each other in order to work successfully and efficiently toward a common goal. One of the main parts of people skills in the work environment include teamwork, mentoring, and being sensitive to other people’s differences.</p>

          <h2>Teamwork</h2>
<p>Working as a team is essential in the success of developing a product. In most companies you work for, you will be on a team working with others on the same product. Successful teams are made up of people who are cooperative and can be leaders or followers depending on the situation. They are able to share responsibility with other team members, whether that means if something is going wrong in the product. Good teammates also show respect towards one another. It is not necessary that everyone on the team is friends but as long as there are not problems that affect the product, it should be fine.</p>
<h2>Mentoring Teammates</h2>
<p>Being a mentor or a mentee is a relationship that exists within teams. Mentoring other teammates is an important skill to have. This makes you more important on the team to the employer and it helps bring others in the group. Mentoring and supporting other teammates that may be new will help them get caught up on the product and help them improve on their work. Most of the real learning in computer science happen on the job. This is why it is important to show others the way and help them learn.</p>
<h2>Sensitivity in the Workplace</h2>
<p>In order to have good people skills you have to be able to understand each other. In the workplace and as a team member, you must be conscious of the feelings of your fellow teammates. If the person is really hurt, then it could turn into low morale or even they could bring legal action against the employer. Everyone comes from different backgrounds and it is important to see where their point of view comes from. There are many suggestions to keep in mind when you are in the workplace.</p>
<p>One is to make sure that you are not saying anything racist against another co-worker or at least something that comes off as a racist remark. Another suggestion is to make sure you don’t make any sexist comments to the other sex. It is important to treat everyone equally when on a team. Also, make sure you don’t say a comment to another co-worker that offends their culture in any way. We all come from different cultural backgrounds since our workforce is becoming more and more diverse. Knowing all these differences will help you have better people skills which will help you look more attractive to potential employers.</p>

            <p>Improving on people skills may not be as straight forward as improving your skills in communication or time management. There are some people skills that are straight forward but overall they are hard to just learn. Overall, you just have to have a positive mind set and make sure you listen to everyone and give them a chance. Take any opportunity you can to help someone else out as long as you can manage to. If you are to practice these skills, they will come easier to you as time goes on.</p>
<p>As for cultural awareness, there are a few techniques you can do to help improve in this area. One technique is to simply research the cultures of your co-workers on your free-time. Looking online and at books will help you understand where they are coming from. Another technique is to ask questions. If you learn something about their culture, ask them about it to learn more about it. This will also help build the relationship between you and your co-worker. Stereotypes are also dangerous in the work area. Make sure you get rid of any stereotypes you have towards the cultures in the office using some of the techniques above.</p>
