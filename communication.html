        <p>Communication is a very broad set of skills that are essential when portraying information to others effectively. Good communication can be the difference between a successful project versus a failed project and the difference between a helpful product and a dangerous product. If you were in the medical field developing a new kind of medicine, communication needs to be perfect. Peoples’ lives are at stake and a slight miscommunication can be a disaster for the customers or the individuals making the medicine.</p>
<p>There are 3 main aspects of communication that you encounter in the work force that your employer would want you to know. These are how to communicate orally, how to write, and how to create and present a presentation.</p>

        <h2>Verbal Communication</h2>
<p>Verbal communication is when an individual is able to convey information to others by speaking. Every day you are verbally communicating with people, whether you are in a group meeting with your co-workers talking about a product, or if you are talking with a stranger on the subway. Not only does communication require proper grammar and a knowledge of the subject being discussed, it also requires you to listen to the other person in the conversation. Listening to the other person’s verbal and non-verbal communication is as important as portraying the information to them. Making an effort to understand what the other person is saying could help you figure out what their thoughts are and help you change what information you want to relay.</p>
<h2>Written Communication</h2>
<p>Written communication is when an individual is able to convey information to others using written word. Every day you are most likely going to communicate through some kind of written form, whether it be online through email, regular mail, and through text. Like verbal communication, proper grammar and knowledge of the subject being discussed has to be understood in order to communicate effectively. Spelling of the words you use are also important.</p>
<h2>Creating and Presenting a Presentation</h2>
<p>Communication through presentation is when an individual gives some kind of visual presentation to relay information to others. This type of communication requires both verbal and written communication. Verbal to present the presentation and written to make the presentation. Presentations don’t happen as often as verbal and written communication. It is important to be able to create and present a presentation efficiently and effectively because it could affect whether a new product idea is accepted or rejected.</p>

            <p>There are many ways to improve upon your communication skills. Some things you can keep in mind before going into a conversation is to make sure you know your material, speak clearly, make eye contact, avoid distractions, use language that your listener(s) can easily understand, and to check in with the listener(s) to make sure they understand.</p>
<p>While writing to another individual, there are also a few things to keep in mind. One is to list each item you need to discuss in the written form of communication. This will help organize everything and make it easier to know where you are going. Another tip is to avoid wordiness. This can shorten the overall length of the document you are writing and it will make it easier for the recipient to read it. Another tip is to write to your audience. Make sure you use language that your audience can understand by stay away from jargon. Not everyone is a programmer or engineer, so they won’t understand the terms that you are used to. Proofreading is also very important when writing to others. You may make a mistake when initially writing, so it is important to read over what you have written to make sure there are no mistakes.</p>
<p>Overall, practice will help you improve upon your communication skills. Practice with friends, or put yourself in situations where you have to use them. With time you will become a proficient communicator.</p>
